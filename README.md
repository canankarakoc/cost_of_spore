# Evolutionary bioenergetics of sporulation

**Last updated:** 26 August 2025

This repository contains the complete analysis pipeline of the manuscript "Evolutionary bioenergetics of sporulation". 
The project integrates genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, and by-the-number datasets to quantify ATP investment across the spore lifecycle, 
compares with other cellular investments.
It also incorporates these estimates into mechanistic models to show how metabolic constraints shape sporulation efficiency, and how this developmental program becomes visible to selection.

## Project Structure

- bioaccounting/:   Bioenergetic calculations using by-the-numbers, spore formation and revival data.
- efficiency/:      Data and plots related to sporulation efficiency across studies. 
                  Models for population dynamics in batch and chemostat conditions and sporulation efficiency.
- evolution/:       Data and figures of sporulation COGs. Model outputs and figures related to evolutionary dynamics.

## Getting Started

- All by-the-numbers calculations in the manuscript are embedded in the  R code with their references, 
such as membrane area and membrane costs calculations, genome size, nucleotide costs, and replication costs.
- Key datasets such as amino acid costs, spore-formation, and revival genes/proteins are listed below. 
- The project includes models and simulations written in Python, and the codes are provided in their respective folder. 

To reproduce the analysis:

1. Run `code\cost_of_spore.R` from the top for bioaccounting. Ensure the working directory is set properly.
2. Run Python codes to reproduce data for population dynamics, spore efficiency, and evolutionary analysis. 
Codes are stored in "efficiency" and "evolution" sections under "model" folders. 
3. Run `efficiency_plots.R` and `COGs_figures.R` to reproduce figures of empirical and model data of 
population dynamics, efficiency, and evolutionary outcomes. These codes are stored under respective sections and "empirical" folders.

## Empirical data for COGs and efficiency 

Spore-related COGs are derived from [Galperin et al. 2022](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jb.00079-22). 
See manuscript, supplementary information for empirical efficiency data derived from various sources.
